**Revenue & Growth Strategy**
**The Problem:** The Executive team needs to know which regions are driving growth and where marketing spend is being wasted.

**SQL Solution:** I developed the trend_orders view using the LAG() window function to calculate Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in order volume.

**Business Impact:** This allows the marketing team to identify seasonal peaks and measure the success of promotional campaigns in real-time.

**Revenue Segmentation:** By creating Total_Revenue_By_Segmentation, I enabled the business to see exactly how much revenue is generated by 'Loyal' vs. 'Churned' customers, justifying the budget for retention programs.

**Operational Efficiency & Logistics**
**The Problem:** High delivery times are leading to bad reviews and customer churn, but the "bottleneck" location is unknown.

**SQL Solution:** I built the SLA_compliance and Avg_Delivery_Delay views using DATEDIFF logic.

**Business Impact:** This isolates whether delays are happening across the board or at specific restaurants. For example, Avg_time_delivery_40mi specifically benchmarks the 40-minute delivery promise to see if it's realistic or needs adjustment.

**Risk Mitigation:** The Cancellation_rate_by_city view flags specific geographic zones where service is failing, allowing operations to pause service in those areas before brand reputation is damaged.

**Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Optimization**
**The Problem:** How do we identify our "Whale" customers to prevent them from moving to a competitor?

**SQL Solution:** I implemented a Percentile-based Ranking system using NTILE(20) to create the high_value_customers view.

**Business Impact:** This automatically filters the Top 5% of customers by revenue. The CRM team can use this list for exclusive "Gold Tier" rewards, significantly increasing retention for the most profitable segment of the user base.

Churn Prevention: The churned_customers view tracks the monthly volume of lost users, serving as an early warning system for the Product team.
